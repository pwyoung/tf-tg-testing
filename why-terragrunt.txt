TF declined to add an "include" feature (even though a working PR existed)
See: https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/1478#issuecomment-513059932
...BUT, TG supports variable import via "read_terragrunt_config()".
See: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example/blob/master/terragrunt.hcl#L12

TF variables can not be functions of other variables.
locals (local variables) can, but this is insufficient.
TG "inputs" solve this problem.
See: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example/blob/4a8569c33088e13938d412f65a27a16d4e2d524b/_envcommon/mysql.hcl#L33-L46

TG makes it easier to manage state.
It automatically creates:
- the remote S3 Bucket
- the remote DynamoDB lock table
- the backend.tf file ... IN EVERY MODULE DIR that needs it, as defined by the presence of a terragrunt.hcl file.
  See: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example/blob/4a8569c33088e13938d412f65a27a16d4e2d524b/non-prod/us-east-1/qa/mysql/terragrunt.hcl
